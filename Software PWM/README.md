# Software PWM
Sean Hastings: For software PWM, TimerA is used in upmode defaulting to a 50% duty cycle for a 1 kHz signal. Since the duty cycle of a PWM is time on/time total, it follows that it will count to CCR0 (the 1 kHz signal) using CCR1, which sets the period by turning on the LED and then shuts off the LED using CCR1 compare mode at a value less than CCR0. Each button press increases CCR1 by 100, and since CCR0 is 1000, it follows that each button press increases the duty cycle by 10%. Each board successfully implemented Software PWM.
